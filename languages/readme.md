# Translations

Right now, this plugin is not available in any other languages, but all available translations for the plugin will be located in this folder.

## Submitting Translations

All translations should follow the file naming model of `eighties-bbpress-ko_KR.po` (using your language). If you are interested submitting a translation for this plugin, you can do so one of two ways:

### Github (Recommended)

If you have a [Github](https://github.com) account, please submit a pull request with your translation (if the language does not already exist).

### Email

If you do not have a [Github](https://github.com) account, you can send the translation to me via email. Please note that I will need both the .mo and .po files.
